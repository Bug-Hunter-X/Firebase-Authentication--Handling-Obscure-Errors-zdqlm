# Firebase Authentication Error Handling
This repository demonstrates a common issue with Firebase Authentication: unclear error messages when authentication fails. The `firebaseBug.js` file shows the problem, while `firebaseBugSolution.js` provides a solution.

The problem stems from the Firebase Authentication SDK sometimes returning vague error messages when the user's credentials are invalid.  The solution involves using a more robust error handling approach to provide more specific feedback to the user.
